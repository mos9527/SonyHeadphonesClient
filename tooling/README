Tooling
---
This folder includes the codegen stuff based on Clang. So do get your Clang/LLVM header
files!

Windows
===
Get the latest release from https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases.

Setup CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, and include `C:\Program Files\LLVM` or wherever you'd installed it.

Linux
===
You are on your own. Your `clang` package probably includes the requisite libs already - if not, try `llvm-dev`

macOS
===
Get `llvm` from Homebrew and add to PATH.
